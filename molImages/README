Automatic generation of figures in pymol

1. Make a new directory with these files and your xyzs
  - script.pml   #controls pymol rendering options
  - make-pml.sh  #makes a different pymol file for each xyz in the current directory
  - run-pml.sh   #runs every pml file in the directory with Sherrill group's pymol

2. Edit script.pml for desired pymol settings (color, background, resolution, etc)

3. Run make-pml.sh

4. Run run-pml.sh. After this step, pngs corresponding to each xyz will be in your directory
